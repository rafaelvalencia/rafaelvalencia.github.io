I am currently a Senior R&D Engineer at TRATON R&D (Scania), working on autonomous driving. Previously, I contributed to self-driving technologies at Zenseact and Zenuity.

Before moving into industry, I was a researcher at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University (USA), as well as at Halmstad University and Örebro University in Sweden. I earned my PhD in Robotics from the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC), Spain.

My research has spanned many aspects of autonomous mobile robot navigation, with a strong focus on perception challenges such as SLAM, state estimation, active perception, and planning under uncertainty.
